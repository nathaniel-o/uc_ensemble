			   Julia Adams:
					Fascinated by the world of liquor, bitters, 
					mixers, garnishes, and glasses, Julia Adams began by 
					making drinks for her family and friends. She now has 
					an eclectic collection of barware and ingredients, and 
					is always looking for new elements with which to experiment. 
					Pleasing the palette is always top priority, of course, 
					but in discovering the contribution the visual makes 
					to taste, she and her husband had fun taking pictures 
					of her cocktails as they were served. What started 
					as a whim has become a sizeable collection of 
					“raw” images – an artistic gallery of cocktails. 
					In addition to exploring the world of cocktails, 
					Julia is a music professor and choral/orchestral conductor.
