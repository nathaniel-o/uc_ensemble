			   Julia Adams:
					Fascinated by the world of liquor, bitters, mixers, garnishes, and glasses, Julia Adams began by
	making drinks for family, friends, and colleagues. She now has an eclectic collection of barware
	and ingredients, and is always looking for new elements with which to experiment. Pleasing the
	palate is always top priority, of course, but in discovering the contribution the visual makes to
	taste, she and her husband had fun taking pictures of their cocktails as they were served. What
	started as a whim has become a sizable collection of “raw” images - an artistic gallery of
	cocktails. In addition to capturing the visual beauty of cocktails, Julia is also the founder and
	owner of Clear Ice &amp; Bitters, providing an in-home, intimate cocktail experience.
