				Our philosophy is that enjoying a cocktail is a multi-sensory encounter, beginning from the all-
				important pour in front of a waiting recipient. The eye observes the glorious swirl of color and
				hue, as the ear detects the crackle when liquid strikes ice. The nose inhales the distinct nuances
				of each ingredient, and the mouth waters as final droplets leave the shaker, rippling the cocktail’s
				surface. As the first sip is drawn, texture and taste complete the experience. It isn’t just a drink,
				it’s an alluring, captivating journey of passion that begins and ends as a work of art. <br></br>
				<span id="uc">UntouchedCocktails.com</span> is the result of a collaborative effort exploring the art of cocktail-
				making as a visually satisfying experience, shared digitally to ensure accessibility for everyone.
				Combining Nathaniel’s coding expertise with Julia’s artistic eye, we’ve had a blast building
				UntouchedCocktails.<br></br>
				We have two parameters. First, the drinks must be literally untouched. The images are captured
				just after the pour and before a sip is taken. And second, you the viewer have the same
				experience as the drinker, with no artificial enhancements other than simple cropping.<br></br>
				Our hope is that cocktail aficionados, fine arts enthusiasts, and lovers of all things beautiful will
				find UntouchedCocktails.com a digital experience that teases the senses, calms the soul, and
				inspires the artist within.
